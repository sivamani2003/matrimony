# Vite Frontend Setup

This project is a Vite-powered frontend application. Follow the steps below to set up and run the application locally.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=14.0)
- [npm](https://npmjs.com) (or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if you prefer)

You can verify the installation of Node.js and npm by running the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sivamani2003/matrimony.git
cd <project-directory>
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies with `npm` (or `yarn` if using Yarn):

```bash
npm install
```

OR if you use Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## 3. Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

OR if using Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The development server should start at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default. Open this URL in your browser to view the frontend.

## 4. Building the Project

To build the project for production, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.

## 5. Preview Production Build

To preview the production build locally, run:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will start a preview server and allow you to view the production build at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4172).

## Troubleshooting

If you face any issues during setup or development, check the following:

- Ensure that you have installed all dependencies correctly by running `npm install`.
- Clear your browser cache and reload the development server.
- Check the terminal for any error logs and trace where the issue might be.

If you encounter any other issues, refer to the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) for more advanced configuration and troubleshooting.
